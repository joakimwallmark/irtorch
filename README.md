`IRTorch` is a Python package for item response theory (IRT). It utilizes [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for model optimization and GPU support.
Check out our [documentation page](https://irtorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for usage examples and API reference.

## Installation
Install from Python Package Index (PyPI)
```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ irtorch
```

Install from GitHub
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/joakimwallmark/irtorch.git
```
