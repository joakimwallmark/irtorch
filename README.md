`IRTorch` is a Python package for item response theory (IRT). It utilizes [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for model optimization and GPU support.
Check out our [documentation page](https://irtorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for usage examples and API reference.

## Installation
Install from [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/irtorch/)
```bash
pip install irtorch
```

Install from [GitHub](https://github.com/joakimwallmark/irtorch)
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/joakimwallmark/irtorch.git
```
